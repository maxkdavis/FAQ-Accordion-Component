# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

## Welcome! üëãüèª

Thank you for viewing my solution to this frontend mentor coding challenge. This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam).

I designed this component with a mobile-view layout and built-out to accomodate the web view.Adding the event listeners was relatively straightforward, but ensuring that the accordion has a smooth display toggle proved to be quite challenging.
